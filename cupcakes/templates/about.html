		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>Tracking political advertising in the wake of the Supreme Court's Citizen United ruling—which allows corporations and labor unions to spend unlimited amounts to elect or defeat federal, state and even local candidates—will be more challenging than ever. To help media organizations, civic groups, academics and others following the 2010 mid-term elections, the Sunlight Foundation is offering Sunlight Campaign Ad Monitor, or Sunlight CAM. Sunlight Cam is a gadget that, once installed, allows visitors to any news website, blog, or the home page of a neighborhood association to report information on ads they see. Click the Sunlight CAM gadget, enter a zip code, find the station (radio, television or cable) that ran the ad, enter some basic information—which politician was mentioned, what was said, was a sponsor named—and click submit. The information entered will be publicly available from our online database, allowing voters to help keep track of who’s trying to influence their choices in the 2010 elections, and giving organizations a great way to engage their online visitors.</p>
