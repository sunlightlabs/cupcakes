		<h2>Using the data</h2>
		<p>This site collects information on the private interests that are sponsoring political advertisements across the country during the election season. The data collected is easily downloadable from the ‘View Reports’ page (LINK) as a CSV document.</p>
		<p>For reporters, bloggers and citizens wanting to do more research on groups that are spending money to run these ads, here are a few tips:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				To find out which political groups are paying for a specific ad, some information is disclosed to the Federal Election Commission and are available online:
				<ul>
					<li><a href="http://www.fec.gov/finance/disclosure/ec_table.shtml">http://www.fec.gov/finance/disclosure/ec_table.shtml</a></li>
					<li><a href="http://www.fec.gov/finance/disclosure/ie_reports.shtml">http://www.fec.gov/finance/disclosure/ie_reports.shtml</a></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Additionally, stations that run political ads are required to collect information from their sponsors.  While this information must be disclosed to the public, it might require a trip to the television or radio station to review it. Best to call the stations in advance. The regulation, which comes from the Federal Communication Commission, requiring the disclosures is <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/mb/policy/political/candrule.htm">available online</a>.</li>
			<li>To hone in on TV stations in a specific area, SunlightCAM uses <a href="http://dtv.gov/broadcastersupport.html">data from the Federal Communications Commission</a>, but similar data listing for radio stations in a particular zip code is unavailable from the FCC. <a href="http://www.radio-locator.com/">Radio-Locator</a> can be help locate radio stations in your area.</li>
